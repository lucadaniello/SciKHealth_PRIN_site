    "text": "SciK-Health\nProject Code: 2022825Y5E\nCUP: E53D2300611006\nFunding Scheme: PRIN 2022 (Progetti di Ricerca di Rilevante Interesse Nazionale)\n\nScientific Knowledge in Health (SciK-Health) is a national research project funded under the PRIN 2022 programme. It investigates the role of scientific production in shaping the quality and effectiveness of patient care within the Italian healthcare system, focusing specifically on Academic Health Science Centres (AHSCs).\nAHSCs are institutions that integrate healthcare delivery, medical education, and research. Their mission is to provide advanced clinical services, train future healthcare professionals, and promote scientific innovation. In recent years, these centres have played an increasingly strategic role in connecting scientific knowledge with clinical practice.\nDespite the growing emphasis on research and innovation, little is known about how scientific output actually translates into measurable improvements in patient care. SciK-Health addresses this gap by combining bibliometric and scientometric analysis with healthcare performance data, aiming to explore the relationship between research activity and clinical outcomes.\n\n\n\nProject Overview\nAcademic Health Science Centres (AHSCs) pursue a threefold strategic mission.\nFirst, they train healthcare professionals to treat and reduce the burden of disease using increasingly effective and valuable health technologies.\nSecond, they serve as innovation hubs for new treatment methods, health technologies, tools, and digital solutions, with the aim of making the European health industry more pioneering, sustainable, and globally competitive.\nThird, they provide advanced, high-quality care through the adoption of groundbreaking and data-driven solutions that are tailored to patient needs.\nBalancing these three missions is inherently complex, and several side effects have been documented—such as strategic ambiguity and organizational tension. While some studies have explored the impact of teaching on patient care, little is known about how the missions interact, particularly regarding the role of research in improving care delivery.\nDisciplines such as bibliometrics and scientometrics have made it possible to measure and analyze scientific outputs. The research production of AHSCs includes not only scientific publications but also clinical trials, patents, research grants, and social impact (e.g., altmetrics). While these outputs are typically measured separately, they remain underutilized as indicators of health system performance.\n\n\n\nOur Contribution\nThe SciK-Health project proposes a three-step contribution:\n\nDatabase Construction\nWe will build a comprehensive database containing bibliometric and scientometric metadata for the scientific output of Italian public AHSCs from 2000 to the present. This longitudinal perspective will help identify atypical patterns and trends.\nComposite Indicator\nWe will measure research productivity, growth, impact, and novelty, and then develop a combined and weighted indicator of scientific output for each AHSC.\nLinking Research and Patient Care\nWe will investigate the extent to which academic research performance affects patient care through an econometric analysis.\nThe patient care dimensions considered will include:\n\n30-day mortality\nHospital readmissions\nWaiting lists\nPatient mobility\nHospital case mix\n\n\nOur core research questions are:\n\nDoes academic research performance in public AHSCs lead to better healthcare outcomes?\nIs academic research performance a driver of hospital case mix?\nDoes academic research performance influence patient mobility?"
